# mcaceresb.github.io/beta

Beta version of my site, based on jarrekk's [Jalpc theme](https://jarrekk.github.io/Jalpc).

## Howto

- `_config.yml`: Edit each section with the requisite information/settings.
- `_data/landing.yml`: Custom sections of index page.
- `_data/index/`: Each page here is a section.
- `_data/blog.yml`: Edit navbar(categories); then each page in blog/ is a blog category. (e.g. `blog/category.html` and add `/category/` to the items title and permalink; make sure the title is `Caterogy`).
- `CNAME`: To release site at custom domain, edit this file and create gh-pages branch. To use with basic github.io domain leave blank.
